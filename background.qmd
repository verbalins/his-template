# Background

This is the background chapter. Here we will show how to include figures and create figures from data. We start by showing how to include data.

## Including data

Here's more text in a subsection. @fig-airquality further explores the impact of temperature on ozone level.

```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: Temperature and ozone level.
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess"
)
```

## Customizing figures

In the introduction we showed how to include a picture, here we will see how we can customize figure output. See [https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html) for further information about including figures.

## Subcaptions from code

```{r}
#| label: fig-charts
#| fig-cap: Charts
#| fig-subcap: 
#|   - "Cars"
#|   - "Pressure"
#| layout-ncol: 2

plot(cars)
plot(pressure)
```
